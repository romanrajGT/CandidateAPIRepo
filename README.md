**Ways for Improvement in the future**
1. Authentication & Authorization: Implement OAuth2 or JWT-based authentication for api access.
2. Advanced Caching: Use distributed caching mechanisms like Redis.
3. Logging: Implement structured logging using Serilog or NLog.
4. Error Handling: Implement global error handling and custom error responses.
5. Documentation: Use Swagger for API documentation.

**Assumptions**
- Using .NET 8
- Nothing at all, just replaced SqlServer with Sqlite in the middle of development so that connections strings are not required to be modified for the targeting machine.

**Time Spent**
- Project setup and initial implementation: 3 hours
- Unit testing: 2 hours
- Documentation and final adjustments: 1 hour
- Total: 6 hours
